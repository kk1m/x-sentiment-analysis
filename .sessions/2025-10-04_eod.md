## 🔄 Key Decisions & Pivots

### Original Plan vs. Actual Implementation

| Aspect | Original Plan | Actual Implementation | Reason |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|---------|
| Data Source | Hashtags (#Bitcoin, #MSTR, #BitcoinTreasuries) | Community ("Irresponsibly Long $MSTR") | More focused, higher quality |
| Schedule | Daily at 11:59 PM | Mon/Wed/Fri/Sun | Free tier constraints |
| Topics | 3 topics | 1 topic (MSTR) | Focused approach |
| Free Tier | 500 tweets/month | 100 tweets/month | Actual X API limits |
| Per Collection | Bulk daily | 5 posts | Quality over quantity |
| Time Window | 24 hours | 72 hours | Matches collection frequency |
| Sentiment | LLM-based | Keyword-based (MVP) | $0 budget MVP |
