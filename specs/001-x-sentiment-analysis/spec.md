---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a cryptocurrency analyst, I want to monitor sentiment trends in the "Irresponsibly Long $MSTR" community by analyzing their X (Twitter) posts 4x per week, so that I can understand how this bullish MSTR investor community's sentiment shifts over time and showcase this analysis publicly as a portfolio credential.

**Weekly Workflow:**
1. System collects top 5 posts from "Irresponsibly Long $MSTR" community on Mon/Wed/Fri/Sun
2. Each post is analyzed for bullish/bearish/neutral sentiment
3. Posts are weighted by visibility (likes, retweets), author influence (followers), verification status, and bot likelihood
4. Daily aggregate sentiment score is calculated and stored
5. User can view historical sentiment trends via API
6. User can compare sentiment results across different analysis algorithms

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Community Post Collection
1. **Given** it is a collection day (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, or Sunday)
   **When** the collection script runs
   **Then** system collects top 5 posts from "Irresponsibly Long $MSTR" community (ID: 1761182781692850326) from the past 72 hours with min 2 retweets
   **And** stores complete post metadata (author, engagement metrics, content, timestamps)

#### Scenario 2: Sentiment Classification
2. **Given** a post containing "Bitcoin to the moon! ðŸš€ $100k incoming"
   **When** sentiment analysis runs
   **Then** post is classified as Bullish with high confidence (>0.8)
   **And** sentiment score is stored with algorithm identifier and version

#### Scenario 3: Weighted Scoring
3. **Given** two posts: Post A (bearish, 1 like) and Post B (bullish, 100 likes)
   **When** daily aggregate sentiment is calculated
   **Then** Post B contributes significantly more weight to the daily sentiment score
   **And** daily sentiment leans bullish

#### Scenario 4: Bot Detection
4. **Given** a post from an account with suspicious patterns (new account, high posting frequency, generic content)
   **When** bot detection runs
   **Then** post is flagged with high bot likelihood score (>0.7)
   **And** post's contribution to sentiment is reduced or excluded

#### Scenario 5: Historical Trend Query
5. **Given** 30 days of collected sentiment data
   **When** user requests sentiment trend for Bitcoin over the past month
   **Then** system returns daily sentiment scores with bullish/bearish/neutral breakdown
   **And** displays trend visualization (line chart)

#### Scenario 6: Algorithm Comparison
6. **Given** sentiment has been analyzed using multiple algorithms (OpenAI, FinBERT, VADER)
   **When** user views sentiment trends
   **Then** system displays separate trend lines for each algorithm
   **And** user can compare how different algorithms scored the same time period

### Edge Cases

**Data Collection:**
- What happens when X API rate limit is reached mid-batch?
  â†’ System pauses, logs quota exhaustion, resumes when quota resets
- What happens when no posts match the search criteria for a day?
  â†’ System logs zero-post day, stores null sentiment score with metadata explaining absence
- What happens when X API returns partial/corrupted data?
  â†’ System validates response, logs errors, stores only valid posts, flags batch as incomplete

**Sentiment Analysis:**
- What happens when a post contains mixed sentiment ("Bitcoin pumping but MSTR dumping")?
  â†’ System assigns dominant sentiment based on algorithm confidence, flags as low-confidence if ambiguous
- What happens when LLM API fails or times out?
  â†’ System falls back to secondary algorithm (local model), logs failure, retries later
- What happens when post is in non-English language?
  â†’ System flags as unsupported language, excludes from analysis (v1.0 English-only)

**Bot Detection:**
- What happens when a verified account exhibits bot-like behavior?
  â†’ Bot detection still runs, but verification status reduces bot likelihood score
- What happens when bot detection is uncertain (score ~0.5)?
  â†’ Post is included but flagged for potential manual review

**Historical Data:**
- What happens when user queries date range with no data?
  â†’ System returns empty result set with clear message "No data available for this period"
- What happens when algorithm version changes and user wants to compare old vs new?
  â†’ System supports reprocessing historical posts with new algorithm, stores both versions

## Dependencies & Assumptions

### External Dependencies
- **X API v2**: Free tier access (100 tweets/month read limit), requires API credentials
- **LLM API**: OpenAI or Anthropic API for primary sentiment analysis, requires API key and budget ($50/month) - Currently using keyword-based placeholder
- **Local ML Models**: Hugging Face transformers for fallback sentiment analysis (FinBERT, crypto-specific models)

### Assumptions
- X API Free Tier is sufficient for focused community tracking (100 tweets/month = 5 posts Ã— 4 days/week Ã— 4 weeks = ~80-85 tweets/month)
- Upgrade to X API Basic tier ($100/month) required for larger scale (10,000 tweets/month)
- Community search (context: operator) captures posts from "Irresponsibly Long $MSTR" community
- English-only posts are sufficient for v1.0 (majority of crypto discussion)
- Mon/Wed/Fri/Sun collection schedule is acceptable (real-time not required)
- Bot detection heuristics can achieve >80% precision without ML model
- Keyword-based sentiment is acceptable for MVP, LLM upgrade provides better accuracy

### Constraints
- Budget: $0/month (free tier only for MVP)
- X API: Free tier limits (100 tweets/month read, 500 tweets/month write)
- Collection: 5 posts per run, 4x per week = ~85 tweets/month
- Language: English only (v1.0)
- Deployment: Local development initially, cloud deployment for public showcase
